          <h1>Missile Man of India</h1>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR </b> (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/
            (listen); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace
            scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India
            from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu
            and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next
            four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
            Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian
            Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
            India's civilian space programme and military missile development
            efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for
            his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974
